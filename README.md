## More about..

- I've seen some developers saying that they love what they do without a second's hesitation. I became a developer because I was indeed inspired from their passion and wanted to be one of them.
- I enjoy thinking through problems on my own and digging deep. [For instance, I love defining my own question about Javascript, research about it and write articles.](https://witch.work/posts?search=js)
